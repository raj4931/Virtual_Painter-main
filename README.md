# Virtual_Painter-main
This is a demonstration of my new project built using python language. Libraries used are mediapipe and opencv also bit of numpy. This is a great project whether you are looking for your minor or major projects you can use this for a lot of use cases.Since this is virtual drawing so you don't really need mouse or keyboard when this app runs everything  is done in air.

There are some features in this app such as :
using this project you can,
draw lines
draw rectangles
draw simple with free hand
draw circles and
ofcourse erase everything with free hand.

For this project we have used mediapipe's solution for hand landmark detection it detects 21 different keypoints but out which we only used 3 keypoints.

Using this app is very simple just select any tool from top by your index finger keep hand there until you see text is changed and now you use this by raising your both index and middle finger at once.
you can alter tool by just following same steps.
